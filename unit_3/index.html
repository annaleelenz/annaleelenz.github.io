<p>
My name is Anna Lenz, and I am a graphic designer. <br>With more than 25 years in the industry, I am proficient in the<br> principles of design, concept development, and typography.<br> I have a strong editorial design background, as well as <br>promotional, marketing, invitation, and visual identity design.<br>
<br>
I read somewhere that success doesn't come from aiming <br>at success, but from doing what you are passionate about<br> to the best of your ability. I am passionate about design.
